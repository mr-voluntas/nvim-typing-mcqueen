MonkeyType style nvim plugin

Notes:
- No setup function needed as this plugin will have great defaults.
- We should mark "private packages" with an _underscore.
- The more we splitup the plugin the slower it becomes.
- Plugin is cached after first require.
- We can do plugin config via vim.g.nvim-typing-mcqueen global table.
- Its faster to only require modules when needed.


Todo:
- Open a floating window
- Add the text that needs to be typed out
- Track keystrokes
- Make text red or green
